# POCD-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Streamlit
This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to predict Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) using structured EHR data. Multiple models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, Naive Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost (regularization path study).
